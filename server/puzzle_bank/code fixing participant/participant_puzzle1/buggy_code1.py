"""
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A college canteen needs a program to calculate the total bill for a student.
1. The program should take a list of prices.
2. It must calculate the total sum of these prices.
3. If the total is more than 500, a 10% discount should be applied.
4. Finally, it should print the total and check if the student gets a 'Free Cookie' 
   (only for bills above 500).
   
FIX 8 ERRORS TO MAKE THE CODE RUN CORRECTLY.
